A.  The lit review section is rather de-focused.  The paragraphs you have would go better in an 
annotated bibl.  What is needed is a more specific review stating how these works are related and particularly their deficiencies w.r.t. the objectives. 

0. Review the papers (or give a table showing which papers use a) parse knowledge, b) other 
linguistic / domain knowledge. c) assume linguistic cues are already translated into logical forms

Then state that in this work

1. Unlike all other prior attempts, here we do not assume that logical forms are already available, nor do we assume the availability of a parser

2. It is therefore able to handle a large range of languages - here we demonstrate for two widely-spoken languages from very different families - English Hindi


B. Instead of talking too much about "Giza++" talk use a term such as "cross-lingual alignment". 
Both in abstract and many points in text.  Refer to GIZA as only the most popular 
scheme and its implementation

C. If the annotations are not too big, replace the references w the annotated bibliography. 

E. As part of the results, discuss some ambiguous / failures / difficulties . 


spend a paragraph near the top talking about resource-rich langauges (those that have 
penn tree-bank like expensive resources - about 5-10 in the world, of the 600+ languages
in wide use). 

2ndly - mention that the POS tags etc used in traditional parsers are not always the
best way to break up language.
