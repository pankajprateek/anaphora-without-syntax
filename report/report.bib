  annote={This paper introduces CAD methods to deal with Constraint Satisfaction Problems related to geometry, at the same time claims to have met the requirement met by the educational domain. The methods show that results must be construction programs to take into account particular cases. A knowledge-based system implemented in Prolog has also been presented.}

  booktitle={ACM SIGPLAN Notices},
  volume={46},
  number={6},
  pages={50--61},
  year={2011},
  organization={ACM},
  annote={Aiming to solve ruler and compass based geometry construction problems, the tool described in this paper claims to have synthesized construction  steps for problems posed from high-school textbooks and examination papers. It focuses on three important insights viz. reduction of symbolic reasoning to concrete reasoning using verification based on random testing, augmenting the instruction set with higher level constructs and simulating backward deduction used by humans by using a goal-based heuristic.}

  title={Can modern statistical parsers lead to better natural language understanding for education?},

  booktitle={Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing},
  pages={415--427},
  year={2012},
  publisher={Springer},
  annote={Focusing on the educational domain, this paper seeks to build robust domain specific natural language understanding modules by suitable preprocessing of the text and use of domain knowledge to deal with parser errors. The paper starts with showing that even off-the-shelf parsers do not perform up to the mark on texts with domain-specific vocabulary and long sentences. The paper also talks about GeoSynth, built using state-of-the-art parsing technology. GeoSynth is a system which can automatically solve geometric constructions word problems.}

@techreport{itzhaky2012solving,
  title={Solving geometry problems using a combination of symbolic and numerical reasoning},
  author={Itzhaky, Shachar and Gulwani, Sumit and Immerman, Neil and Sagiv, Mooly},
  year={2012},
  institution={Technical report, Tel Aviv University},
  annote={This paper combines deductive, numeric and inductive reasoning to solve geometric problems. Using a mixture of these methods, several problems are solved which, otherwise, wouldn't have been solved using the methods individually. The paper uses the number of nondeterministic choices as a measure of how close a partial program is to the solution, claiming this to be useful in grading and providing hints to the students. The implementation takes an average of few seconds on 18 Scholastic Aptitude Test geometry problems and 11 other ruler and compass-based geometry construction problems.}

  author={Zettlemoyer, Luke S and Collins, Michael},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.1420},
  year={2012},
  annote={With the objective of mapping natural language sentences to their counterpart lambda-calculus encoding, this paper introduces an algorithm which learns from the input set of natural language sentences labeled with lambda calculus expressions. The algorithm attempts to infer the underlying distribution over semantic and syntactic analyses conditioned on the input sentences and outputs a log-linear model.}
